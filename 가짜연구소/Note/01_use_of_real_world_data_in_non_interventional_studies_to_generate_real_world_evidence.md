## 1. Definition of NIS(Non-Interventional Studies)

- A NIS is a clinical study that does not fulfill any of the conditions defining a clinical trial(CT)

- RWD(Real-world data) are data that describe patient chaaracteristics (including treatment utilisation and outcomes) in routine clinical practice. 

- RWE(Real-World Evidence) is evidence derived from the analysis of RWD.

- CTs are the main source of evidence to evaluate the benefits and risks of medicines in marketing authorisation procedures. As they generally use randomisation, blinding, and a controlled environment,they increase regulators’ confidence in the reliability of the evidence submitted. 

- NIS are often used in post-authorisation safety assessment. Their use for assessing medicines efficacy is hindered by methodological limitations. These include absence of randomisation, uncontrolled conditions, non61 standardised treatments and uncertainties regarding data quality and completeness.

- Examples where NIS using RWD have supported regulatory assessment include:

    - To perform post marketing monitoring, investigate safety concerns and evaluate the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures.

    - To describe patterns of drug utilisation (e.g. indication, characteristics of drug users, incidence and prevalence of use, doses, duration, and switching patterns).

    - To characterise disease epidemiology (incidence, prevalence, risk factors and progression).

    - To validate outcome measures, e.g. through a comparison of surrogate and clinical outcomes of disease progression.

    - To support the feasibility assessments and the planning of non-interventional post authorisation safety (PASS), efficacy (PAES) and drug utilisation studies by measuring outcome incidence, treatment exposure, the duration of available follow-up and the sample size effect of different inclusion/exclusion criteria.

    - To compare patient characteristics of the study population to those of the clinical practice population in the real-world.

    - To understand the clinical context, by describing standards of care, variability in clinical practices and unmet medical needs. 


## 2. Data Quality & NIS

- A large variety of RWD can be used in NIS, such as data related to healthcare services utilisation, medical claims, prescribing and dispensing of medicinal products, socio-economic and lifestyle data, data from patient registries, data from healthcare professionals’ and patients’ surveys, data collected with wearable biometric devices and genetic data. 

- A critical aspect when assessing the suitability of RWD for a regulatory purpose is the data quality, including data reliability and relevance as described in Chapter 6, and, depending on the research question, the extent to which RWD truly reflects routine clinical practice. 

- In this context, the data quality frameworks discussed in this document should be considered.

- The regulatory assessment does not mandate a specific study design but requires that the evidence generated is sufficiently reliable to support the regulatory objective. 

- The relevance of a NIS using RWD to generate RWE for a specific application can therefore only be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## 3. Study Design

### 3.1 General Considerations

- For any type of NIS, it is essential that the research question is expressed with sufficient detail and attention to the regulatory question targeted. 

- The specific aim of the study forms the basis for the selection of data source(s), study design, and analysis approach. It also allows the critical discussion regarding the feasibility of the study to meet regulatory objectives.
